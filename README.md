# Pair Programming Workshop Starter

## Background

Claim: Pair Programming is a skill. Like any other skill (playing an instrument, public speaking), it can and should be practiced deliberately, both in isolation and in tandem with other related skills.

This is the starter codebase for a pair programming workshop run by Wenley Tong covering unit testing. It is intended to provide an environment and progression to:
1. Practice the skill of pair programming
2. See different modes / paradigms for doing pair programming
3. See the benefits + limits of Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Supported Languages:
- Ruby
- Javascript

More languages will be added at request.
